# Portland Crimes

The contents of this data set comes from public data available on the city of Portland website. Each individual crime reported is lists the location, time and date of the incident as well as a the neighborhood in which the event occurred.

All data prior to 2015 has the same general format but the newer 2015-17 data needs to be reformatted for easier comparison since it does not match the older organizational scheme. To this end I will be adding new .csv with 2015 , 2016, and 2017 YTD data broken out. Coordinate data will also be added to make the data sets more easily comparable and mappable.

Update: I created new .csv for each year 2015-2017 changing the formatting from the Portland Police Department's tab separated values to the standard comma separated values. The pre-2015 data still isn't comparable because of the differences in the crime categorization but I will work creating some sort of key so that the full data set can be analyzed as a single batch of information.
